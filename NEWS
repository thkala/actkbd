0.2.8:
	* Fixed the auto-detection code so that it fails with an error when no
	  input devices are present at all, rather than letting actkbd attempt
	  to use /dev/input/event0 and fail with some misleading error message
	  (reported by Jerome Borme).
	* Added a sample rule file for udev
	* Note that a udev rule is the recommended way to launch actkbd on Linux
	* Remove version.h - the version string is automatically set in the
	  Makefile
	* Documentation updates
